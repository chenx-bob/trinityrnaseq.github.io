= Trinity and Tuxedo RNA-Seq Workshop =

Do you want to learn the basics of how to analyze RNA-Seq data, including genome-based and genome-free transcript reconstruction and differential expression analysis?  Below, we provide materials to help get you started. A VirtualBox virtual machine image is provided that includes several popular tools for analyzing RNA-Seq, including Tuxedo for genome-based and Trinity for genome-free RNA-Seq studies, and small sample RNA-Seq data sets.  Hands-on tutorials are provided to guide users in a step-by-step analysis of these data.

The slides from the lecture part of the workshop are available ftp://ftp.broad.mit.edu/pub/users/bhaas/rnaseq_workshop/rnaseq_workshop_2014/rnaseq_workshop_slides.pdf[here].
