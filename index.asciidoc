= RNA-Seq De novo Assembly Using Trinity =

image:images/TrinityCompositeLogo.png["Trinity_logo", float="left"]

Trinity, developed at the http://www.broadinstitute.org[Broad Institute] and the http://www.cs.huji.ac.il[Hebrew University of Jerusalem], represents a novel method for the efficient and robust de novo reconstruction of transcriptomes from RNA-seq data. Trinity combines three independent software modules: Inchworm, Chrysalis, and Butterfly, applied sequentially to process large volumes of RNA-seq reads. Trinity partitions the sequence data into many individual de Bruijn graphs, each representing the transcriptional complexity at at a given gene or locus, and then processes each graph independently to extract full-length splicing isoforms and to tease apart transcripts derived from paralogous genes.  Briefly, the process works like so:

- *Inchworm* assembles the RNA-seq data into the unique sequences of transcripts, often generating full-length transcripts for a dominant isoform, but then reports just the unique portions of alternatively spliced transcripts.

- *Chrysalis* clusters the Inchworm contigs into clusters and constructs complete de Bruijn graphs for each cluster.  Each cluster represents the full transcriptonal complexity for a given gene (or sets of genes that share sequences in common).  Chrysalis then partitions the full read set among these disjoint graphs.

- *Butterfly* then processes the individual graphs in parallel, tracing the paths that reads and pairs of reads take within the graph, ultimately reporting full-length transcripts for alternatively spliced isoforms, and teasing apart transcripts that corresponds to paralogous genes.

Trinity was published in http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3571712/[Nature Biotechnology].  Our protocol for transcriptome assembly and downstream analysis is now published in http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3875132/[Nature Protocols]

[[installation]]
== Installing Trinity ==

=== Local Installation of Trinity on a High-memory Linux Server ===

After https://sourceforge.net/projects/trinityrnaseq/files/[downloading] the sofware to a Linux server, simply type 'make' in the base installation directory.  This should build Inchworm and Chrysalis, both written in C++.  Butterfly should not require any special compilation, as its written in Java and already provided as portable precompiled software.

Trinity has been tested and is supported on Linux.

[[Computing_Grid]]
== Adapting Trinity to a computing grid for parallel processing of naively parallel steps ==

Trinity has many parallel-components, all of which can benefit from having multiple CPUs on a single server, but there are also cases such as in Chrysalis and Butterfly where tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of commands can be executed in parallel, each having independent inputs and outputs.  These naively-parallel commands can be most efficiently computed in the context of a compute farm, submitting each of the commands (or batches of them) to individual nodes on the computing grid.  There are several different computing grid job management systems that are in common use, such as SGE or LSF.

Trinity currently supports both SGE and LSF.  To leverage either, simply run 'Trinity --grid_conf your_conf_file.txt', where your_conf_file.txt is a very simple configuration file that indicates parameters for the grid job submission. For example, at the Broad and using LSF, a configuration file might contain the following:

 #-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 # grid type: 
 grid=LSF
 
 # template for a grid submission
 cmd=bsub -q regevlab -R "rusage[mem=10]"
 # note -e error.file -o out.file are set internally, so dont set them in the above cmd. 
 
 # uses the LSF feature to pre-exec and check that the file system is mounted before executing.
 # this helps when you have some misbehaving grid nodes that lost certain file mounts.
 mount_test=T
 
 ##########################################################################################
 # settings below configure the Trinity job submission system, not tied to the grid itself.
 ##########################################################################################
 
 # number of grid submissions to be maintained at steady state by the Trinity submission system 
 max_nodes=500
 
 # number of commands that are batched into a single grid submission job.
 cmds_per_node=100

 #--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


where the above indicates that LSF is the grid type (either LSF or SGE are supported), the queue to submit to is our 'regevlab' named queue, and memory is set to 10 gigabytes. Up to 500 jobs will be submitted at any given time (throttled by the Trinity-included job management system), and the jobs are batched at 10 commands per submission (so, for example, 10 butterfly jobs will be submitted as a single grid job, each being executed serially).

For SGE, at the Broad Institute, we might specify a configuration:

 #--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 # grid type: 
 grid=SGE
 # template for a grid submission
 cmd=qsub -V -cwd
 # number of grid submissions to be maintained at steady state by the Trinity submission system 
 max_nodes=500
 # number of commands that are batched into a single grid submission job.
 cmds_per_node=1
 #--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

where, SGE is indicated as the grid type.  We don't need to specify a queue name, apparently, as it gets submitted to the default queue, and the default memory allocation is sufficient. The project_code can also be left blank unless your SGE configuration requires it.  The maximum number of nodes to throttle the jobs at (500) and the number of commands executed in a single grid job (10) is the same as what we show above for our LSF configuration.

Likewise, for SLURM, we have:

 #---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 # grid type: 
 grid=SLURM
 # template for a grid submission
 cmd=sbatch -p queue_name --mem=10000 --time=02:00:00 
 # number of grid submissions to be maintained at steady state by the Trinity submission system 
 max_nodes=4000
 # number of commands that are batched into a single grid submission job.
 cmds_per_node=20
 #----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Example configuration files are provided under $TRINITY_HOME/htc_conf

Similar support for PBS is underway and planned for a future Trinity release.

[NOTE]
Trinity performs best with strand-specific data, in which case sense and antisense transcripts can be resolved.  For protocols on strand-specific RNA-Seq, see: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21943893[Borodina T, Adjaye J, Sultan M. A strand-specific library preparation protocol for RNA sequencing. Methods Enzymol. 2011;500:79-98. PubMed PMID: 21943893].


If you have strand-specific data, specify the library type.  There are four library types:

- Paired reads:
    * *RF*: first read (/1) of fragment pair is sequenced as anti-sense (reverse(*R*)), and second read (/2) is in the sense strand (forward(*F*)); typical of the dUTP/UDG sequencing method.
    * *FR*: first read (/1) of fragment pair is sequenced as sense (forward), and second read (/2) is in the antisense strand (reverse)

- Unpaired (single) reads:
    * *F*: the single read is in the sense (forward) orientation
    * *R*: the single read is in the antisense (reverse) orientation

By setting the *--SS_lib_type* parameter to one of the above, you are indicating that the reads are strand-specific.  By default, reads are treated as not strand-specific.

image:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3875132/bin/nihms-537313-f0006.jpg[strand-specific library type]

Other important considerations:

- Whether you use Fastq or Fasta formatted input files, be sure to keep the reads oriented as they are reported by Illumina, if the data are strand-specific. This is because, Trinity will properly orient the sequences according to the specified library type.  If the data are not strand-specific, now worries because the reads will be parsed in both orientations.

- If you have both paired and unpaired data, and the data are NOT strand-specific, you can combine the unpaired data with the left reads of the paired fragments.  Be sure that the unpaired reads have a /1 as a suffix to the accession value similarly to the left fragment reads.  The right fragment reads should all have /2 as the accession suffix.  Then, run Trinity using the --left and --right parameters as if all the data were paired.

- If you have multiple paired-end library fragment sizes, set the '--group_pairs_distance' according to the larger insert library.  Pairings that exceed that distance will be treated as if they were unpaired by the Butterfly process.  

- by setting the '--CPU option', you are indicating the maximum number of threads to be used by processes within Trinity. Note that Inchworm alone will be internally capped at 6 threads, since performance will not improve for this step beyond that setting)


[[typical_usage]]
== Typical Trinity Command Line == 

A typical Trinity command for assembling non-strand-specific RNA-seq data would be like so, running the entire process on a single high-memory server (aim for ~1G RAM per ~1M ~76 base Illumina paired reads, but often *much* less memory is required):

Run Trinity like so:

   Trinity --seqType fq --JM 50G --left reads_1.fq  --right reads_2.fq --CPU 6

If you have multiple sets of fastq files, such as corresponding to multiple tissue types or conditions, etc., you can indicate them to Trinity like so:

   Trinity --seqType fq --JM 50G  --left condA_1.fq,condB_1.fq,condC_1.fq --right condA_2.fq,condB_2.fq,condC_2.fq --CPU 6  

Also note that fastq files can be gzip-compressed, in which case they should require a '.gz' extension.

Example data and sample pipeline are provided and described <<sample_data, here>>.

[[typical_options]]
== Options to Consider when Running Trinity ==

Trinity includes additional options to automate various aspects of RNA-Seq read processing that should be considered prior to executing the de novo assembly. This includes quality trimming of reads (using http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic[Trimmomatic]), or in silico normalization of the total reads to reduce the number of reads that are subject to de novo assembly, improving on assembly run-time.  Also, if transcripts are derived from a compact genome where overlapping UTRs are common, options are provided to mitigate the assembly of falsely end-to-end fused transcripts by analyzing the consistency of the read pairings across the length of the transcripts. These options are each detailed below.

[[trimmomatic]]
=== Quality trimming using Trimmomatic ===
To perform quality trimming of inputted fastq files, use 'Trinity --trimmomatic'.  The default settings for quality trimming are described under the full usage info for Trinity (use 'Trinity --show_full_usage_info' for complete usage info):

 ################################################################################
 #### Quality Trimming Options ####  
 # 
 #  --quality_trimming_params <string>   defaults to: "LEADING:5 TRAILING:5 MINLEN:36"
 #
 ################################################################################

The various options that are available for the Trimmomatic software are described on the http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic[Trimmomatic software website].  The Trimmomatic software is bundled as a trinity plugin for convenience.


[[insilinorm]]
== Assembling Large RNA-Seq Data Sets (hundreds of millions to billions of reads) ==

If you have especially large RNA-Seq data sets involving many hundreds of millions of reads to billions of reads, consider performing an in silico normalization of the full data set using 'Trinity --normalize_reads'.  The default normalization process should work well for most data sets. If you prefer to manually set normalization-related parameters, you can find the options under the full Trinity usage info:

 ################################################################################
 ####  In silico Read Normalization Options ###
 #
 #  --normalize_max_read_cov <int>       defaults to 50
 #  --normalize_by_read_set              run normalization separate for each pair of fastq files,
 #                                       then one final normalization that combines the individual normalized reads.
 #                                       Consider using this if RAM limitations are a consideration.
 #
 ################################################################################


If you are interested in running the normalization utility outside of Trinity, you can run it directly as described link:trinity_insilico_normalization.html[here].  

[[jaccard_clip]]
=== Minimizing Fusion Transcripts Derived from Gene Dense Genomes (using --jaccard_clip)  ===

If your transcriptome RNA-seq data are derived from a gene-dense compact genome, such as from fungal genomes, where transcripts may often overlap in UTR regions, you can minimize fusion transcripts by leveraging the *--jaccard_clip* option if you have paired reads.  Trinity will examine the consistency of read pairings and fragment transcripts at positions that have little read-pairing support.  In expansive genomes of vertebrates and plants, this is unnecessary and not recommended.  In compact fungal genomes, it is highly recommended.  In addition to requiring paired reads, you must also have the http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml[Bowtie] short read aligner installed.  As part of this analysis, reads are aligned to the Inchworm contigs using Bowtie, and read pairings are examined across the Inchworm contigs, and contigs are clipped at positions of low pairing support.  These clipped Inchworm contigs are then fed into Chrysalis for downstream processing.  

Note, by using strand-specific RNA-Seq data alone, you should greatly mitigate the incorrect fusion of minimally overlapping transcripts.

[[genome_guided]]
=== Genome-guided Trinity  ===

If a genome sequence is available, Trinity offers a method whereby reads are first aligned to the genome, partitioned according to locus, followed by de novo transcriptome assembly at each locus.

Users can provide read alignments to Trinity as a coordinate-sorted bam file, or Trinity will run GSNAP directly to generate the read alignments (requires installation of http://research-pub.gene.com/gmap/[GSNAP]).

To run Genome-guided Trinity and have Trinity execute GSNAP to align the reads, run Trinity like so:

  Trinity --genome genome.fasta --genome_guided_max_intron 10000 --genome_guided_sort_buffer 10G \
          --genome_guided_CPU 4 --GMAP_CPU 10 \
          --seqType fq --JM 2G --left reads_1.fq  --right reads_2.fq --CPU 10 

Of course, use a maximum intron length that makes most sense given your targeted organism.


Each of the sets of genome-partitioned reads will be executed locally at the --CPU jobs in parallel setting.  The --JM and --genome_guided_CPU parameters correspond to the RAM and thread allocations to each of these smaller assembly jobs. For example, if you're running --CPU 10 parallel assemblies, with each allocating --JM 10G of RAM and using --genome_guided_CPU 4 number of threads. (10G x 10 = 100G of RAM, and 4 * 10 = 40 threads).  Use the --grid_conf parameter to execute the parallel jobs using SGE or LSF rather than executing them locally via multithreading. 

The --GMAP_CPU parameter allows you to separately configure the GMAP alignment process to use a different number of threads than the other parts of the process.  Note, the --GMAP_CPU and the --genome_guided_CPU parameters default to the ---CPU setting, if you choose not to specify them directly.

The --genome_guided_sort_buffer setting is used during the initial stage of preparing the read paritions. It will default to the --JM setting. Because the --JM setting for the individual assembly commands can be relatively small compared to what is needed for a full de novo assembly, you may wish to keep the --JM value small (ie. 2G) while setting the --genome_guided_sort_buffer to a much higher value (ie. 10G or more).

If you decide to run your own RNA-Seq alignments separately using your method of choice, simply provide that coordinate-sorted bam file to Trinity like so:

  Trinity --genome genome.fasta --genome_guided_use_bam rnaseq_alignments.csorted.bam \
          --genome_guided_max_intron 10000 --genome_guided_sort_buffer 10G \
          --genome_guided_CPU 4 \
          --seqType fq --JM 2G --left reads_1.fq  --right reads_2.fq --CPU 10 


[NOTE]
Be sure to include additional options such as '--SS_lib_type' and '--jaccard_clip' where appropriate.  If quality trimming or normalization are indicated, these processes will be performed prior to aligning the reads to the genome.


In summary, the genome-guided Trinity involves two major phases.  The first phase involves partitioning genome-aligned reads into subsets that will each be targeted for independent Trinity de novo assembly.  

This first phase of either aligning reads (or using an existing coordinate-sorted bam file) happens on a single server, runs multithreaded, and leverages the parameters:

      --genome <string>  (ie. genome.fasta) 
      --genome_guided_max_intron <int>  (ie. '10000')
      --genome_guided_sort_buffer <string> (ie. '10G')
      --CPU <int>  (ie. 10)
      --GMAP_CPU <int>  (ie. 10, defaults to --CPU setting)
         or use: --genome_guided_use_bam <string>   (ie. gsnap.coordSorted.bam)

The second phase involves running Trinity de novo assembly on each of the partitioned sets of reads.  If you end up with tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of sets of partitioned reads, this means that you'll have that large number of de novo assemblies to execute (in parallel). Each of these parallel-executed commands leverages the parameters:

     --genome_guided_CPU <int>  (ie. 4, *beware* that this defaults to --CPU)
     --JM <string>   (ie. '2G', note that not much RAM is required for assembly of these relative small sets of reads)

If you specify --grid_conf <string>, then the commands in this second phase will be executed in parallel on your compute farm, using LSF, SGE, or other supported method.  Otherwise, these commands will be executed locally using our Parafly parallel command processor, throttled at --CPU number of parallel processes.

[[genome_annotation]]
=== Comprehensive transcriptome-based genome annotation using Trinity and PASA ===

The Trinity-reconstructed transcripts can be used to annotate genomes using PASA.  Documentation for this is provided on the PASA website under http://pasa.sourceforge.net/#A_ComprehensiveTranscriptome[Build a Comprehensive Transcriptome Database Using Genome-guided and De novo RNA-Seq Assembly] link.

[[trinity_output]]
== Output of Trinity ==

When Trinity completes, it will create a 'Trinity.fasta' output file in the 'trinity_out_dir/' output directory (or output directory you specify).  

Trinity groups transcripts into clusters based on shared sequence content. Such a transcript cluster is very loosely referred to as a 'gene'. This information is encoded in the Trinity fasta accession.  An example Fasta entry for one of the transcripts is formatted like so:

 >c115_g5_i1 len=247 path=[31015:0-148 23018:149-246]
 AATCTTTTTTGGTATTGGCAGTACTGTGCTCTGGGTAGTGATTAGGGCAAAAGAAGACAC
 ACAATAAAGAACCAGGTGTTAGACGTCAGCAAGTCAAGGCCTTGGTTCTCAGCAGACAGA
 AGACAGCCCTTCTCAATCCTCATCCCTTCCCTGAACAGACATGTCTTCTGCAAGCTTCTC
 CAAGTCAGTTGTTCACAGGAACATCATCAGAATAAATTTGAAATTATGATTAGTATCTGA
 TAAAGCA

The accession encodes the Trinity 'gene' and 'isoform' information. In the example above, the accession 'c115_g5_i1' indicates Trinity read cluster 'c115', gene 'g5', and isoform 'i1'.  Because a given run of trinity involves many many clusters of reads, each of which are assembled separately, and because the 'gene' numberings are unique within a given processed read cluster, the 'gene' identifier should be considered an aggregate of the read cluster and corresponding gene identifier, which in this case would be 'c115_g5'.

So, in summary, the above example corresponds to 'gene id: c115_g5' encoding 'isoform id: c115_g5_i1'.

[[compute_requirements]]
== Hardware and Configuration Requirements ==

The Inchworm and Chrysalis steps can be memory intensive.  A basic recommendation is to have ~1G of RAM per ~1M pairs of Illumina reads. Simpler transcriptomes (lower eukaryotes) require less memory than more complex transcriptomes such as from vertebrates.  

If you are able to run the entire Trinity process on a single high-memory multi-core server, indicate the number of butterfly processes to run in parallel by the --CPU parameter. 

Our experience is that the entire process can require ~1/2 hour to one hour per million pairs of reads in the current implementation (see link:trinity_faq.html[FAQ]).  We're striving to improve upon both memory and time requirements.


If you do not have direct access to a high memory machine (typically having 256G or 512G of RAM), consider <<RunElsewhere, running Trinity on one of the externally available resources>>.


If you are limited to the amount of time available for executing Trinity (due to artificially imposed limits on a shared computing resource), you can aim to run Trinity in separate stages, where subsequent stages resume from the previous ones.  To do so, include the following options for each of the stages:

- Stage 1: generate the kmer-catalog using jellyfish '--no_run_inchworm' 
- Stage 2: run Inchworm to generate draft contigs:  '--no_run_chrysalis'
- Stage 2: Chrysalis clustering of inchworm contigs and mapping reads: '--no_run_quantifygraph'
- Stage 3: Chrysalis deBruijn graph construction: '--no_run_butterfly'
- Stage 4: Run butterfly, generate final Trinity.fasta file.  (exclude '--no_' options)



[[monitoring_trinity]]
== Monitoring the Progress of Trinity ==
Since Trinity can easily take several days to complete, it is useful to be able to monitor the process and to know at which stage (Inchworm, Chrysalis, Butterfly) Trinity is currently at.  There are a few general ways to do this:

- by running 'top', you'll be able to see which Trinity process is running and how much memory is being consumed.
- other downstream process will generate standard output.  Be sure to capture 'stdout' and 'stderr' when you run the Trinity script.  The format for capturing both stdout and stderr depends on your SHELL.  Figure out what shell you have by running:

      env | grep SHELL

    Using tcsh:

         Trinity ... opts ... > & run.log &

    Using bash:

        Trinity ... opts ... > run.log 2>&1 &

Note, under bash, to prevent the background process from being terminated once you close the shell, type 'exit' to leave the shell, or explore alternatives such as http://www.serverwatch.com/tutorials/article.php/3935306/Detach-Processes-With-Disown-and-Nohup.htm[nohup, disown, or screen].

You can then 'tail -f run.log' to follow the progress of the Trinity throughout the various stages.


[[sample_data]]
== Running Trinity on Sample Data ==

The Trinity software distribution includes sample data in the 'sample_data/test_Trinity_Assembly/' directory. Simply run the included 'runMe.sh' shell script to execute the Trinity assembly process with provided paired strand-specific Illumina data derived from mouse.  Running Trinity on the sample data requires <~2G of RAM and should run on an ordinary desktop/laptop computer.  Run as 'runMe.sh 1' to execute downstream analysis steps, including bowtie read alignment and RSEM-based abundance estimation, as described below.
